Research experience
======
* 2019.08-2020.02: Master thesis: Temperature Dependency of a low-cost IMU
  * Organization: Institute for Navigation, University of Stuttgart
  * Work: 1) Developed a Python driver for MPU9250 to collect data from FIFO register via I2C protocol
          2) Connect MPU-9250 with Raspberry Pi and control the sensor via Linux command
          3) Collect static data from 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis gyroscope under different temperature points and also a cooling down process
          4) Generate 2D and 3D Allan Deviation by MATLAB, calculate the Bias Instability and Random Walk
          5) Analyze the effects of temperature on the sensor. 
          6) Build up polynomial temperature compensation for the data.
