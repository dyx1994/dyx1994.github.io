Hi, welcome to my home page. My name is Yongxu Duan, born in PR China. I got my master degree just two years ago from Germany and started my career in China. I'm currently working as a geomatics project engineer for Shanghai Investigation, Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd., which is a part of China Three Gorges Corporation. My tasks are to manage geomatics technical problems on site, customer relation maintanance, project management or our contractor, etc. Previously, I was a system engineer in Space Star Technology Co.,Ltd., which is a part of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation. My task was to design and integrate satellite ground system, including satellite control center, remote sensing image processing system, satellite operation management system, etc. Technical documents writing and translation were also my duties. Since our customers were from abroad, providing remote technical support and software deployment were also part of my daily work.

I have strong interest in G
